## About

The project visualizes Estonian local goverment budget data. The [bubbletree](https://github.com/okfn/bubbletree) visualization code is created by [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/) for [OpenSpending](https://openspending.org/) / [OKFN](https://okfn.org/).
 
## Development

To add portability and ease deployment  all third-party libraries are committed to the repository. For development it's recommended to re-download the requirements using npm:

```
sudo rm -R node_modules
npm install
```
